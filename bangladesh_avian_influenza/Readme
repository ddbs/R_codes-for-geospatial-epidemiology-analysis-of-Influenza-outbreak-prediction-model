Between March 2007 and June 2011, 520 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI, subtype H5N1) outbreaks in poultry were reported in 156 out of 486 sub-districts in Bangladesh. 65,451 farms information collected from a new national farm survey program. This study analyzed the temporal and spatial patterns of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks and quantified the relationship between several spatial risk factors and HPAI outbreaks in sub-districts in Bangladesh by using 5 years outbreaks data and new farm survey data.
